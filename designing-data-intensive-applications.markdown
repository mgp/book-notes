## Designing Data-Intensive Applications

by Martin Kleppmann

### Chapter 1: Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

* Many applications are data-intensive and not compute intensive, meaning the biggest problems are usually the amount of data, the complexity of data, and the speed at which it is changing.

#### Thinking About Data Systems

* No single tool can meet all data processing and storage needs. Instead work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single tool, and application code stitches those tools together.
* When you create an API in front of several tools, you have created a new, special-purpose data system from smaller, general-purpose components.
* This book focuses on three main concerns: reliability, scalability, and maintainability.

#### Reliability

* Reliability means the system continues to work correctly, even when things go wrong.
* Things that can go wrong are called *faults*, and systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called *fault-tolerant* or *resilient*.
* A *fault* is when one component of the system deviates from its spec, whereas a *failure* is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.
* You cannot reduce the possibility of a fault to zero, and so you must design fault-tolerance mechanisms that prevent faults from causing failures.

##### Hardware Faults

* Hard disks have a MTTF of 10 to 50 years, and so on a storage cluster with 10,000 disks, we should expect on average one disk to die per day.

##### Software Errors

* Systemic errors, such as leap second bugs or cascading failures, are correlated across nodes and so tend to cause more system failures than uncorrelated hardware faults.

##### Human Errors

* Allow quick recovery from human errors, such as making it fast to rollback configuration changes, and to roll out code gradually.
* Set up detailed and clear monitoring, such as performance metrics and error rates.

#### Scalability

* Scalability is the term we use to describe a system's ability to cope with increased load.

##### Describing Load

* Load can be described with a few numbers that we call *load parameters*. The best choice of parameters depends on the architecture of your system.
* For Twitter, the distribution of followers per user is a key load parameter for describing scalability, as it determines the fan-out load.

##### Describing Performance

* You can look at what happens when load increases in two ways:
  * When you increase a load parameter and keep system resources fixed, how is the performance of your system affected?
  * When you increase a load parameter, how much do you need to increase the resources if you want to keep performance unchanged?
* Response time what the client sees, including the time to process the request (the service time) and network delays and queuing delays.
* Latency is the duration that a request is waiting to be handled – during which it is *latent*, awaiting service.
* The mean is not a good metrics to describe the "typical" response time, as it doesn't tell you how many users experienced that delay. Prefer percentiles instead.
* High percentiles of response times, or tail latencies, are important because they directly affect users' experience of the service.
* Reducing response times at high percentiles is difficult because they are easily affected by random events outside your control, and the benefits are diminishing.
* When artificially generating load to test scalability, the client must send requests independently of the response time, or else it will artificially keep the queues shorter than in reality, thereby skewing the measurements.
* Even if you call multiple backend services in parallel, the end-user request must wait for the slowest of the parallel calls to complete.
* Averaging percentiles, such as when combining data from several machines, is mathematically meaningless. The right way of aggregating response time data is to add the histograms.

##### Approaches for Coping with Load

* Scaling up, or vertical scaling, is moving to a more powerful machine. Scaling out, or horizontal scaling, distributes the load across multiple smaller machines.
* An architecture that scales well for a particular application is built around assumptions of operations will be common and which will be rare – the load parameters.
* In an early-stage startup it's more important to be able to iterate quickly on product features than to scale beyond some hypothetical future load.

#### Maintainability

* The majority of the cost of software is not in its initial development, but its ongoing maintenance.
* Three important design principles for maintainability are:
  * Operability: Make it easy for the operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
  * Simplicity: Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system by removing complexity.
  * Evolvability (or extensibility): Make it easy for engineers to adapt the system to unanticipated use cases as requirements change.

##### Operability: Making Life Easy for Operations

* Good operations can work around the limitations of bad software, but good software cannot run reliably with bad operations.
* A good operations team works to preserve the organization's knowledge about the system, even as individuals come and go.
* Data systems with good operability provide good default behavior but allow overriding, and exhibit predictable behavior to minimize surprises.

##### Simplicity: Managing Complexity

* Making a system simpler does not necessarily mean reducing its functionality; it can also mean removing *accidental complexity*.
* Accidental complexity is complexity that is not inherent in the problem that the software solves, but arises only from the implementation.
* Good abstractions are one of the best tools for removing accidental complexity by hiding implementation details, but finding good abstractions is very hard.

##### Evolvability: Making Change Easy

* Simple and easy-to-understand systems are usually easier to modify than complex ones.

#### Summary

* Functional requirements are what an application should do.
* Nonfunctional requirements are general properties like security, reliability, compliance, scalability, compatibility, and maintainability.
