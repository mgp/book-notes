## Never Split The Difference: Negotiating As If Your Life Depended On It

by Chris Voss

#### Chapter 1: The New Rules

* No matter how we dress up negotiation in mathematical theories, we still act like animals, driven by our fears, needs, perceptions, and desires.
* The book Getting to Yes assumes that the animalistic, emotional brain could be overcome through a rational, joint problem-solving mindset.
* It focused on separating people from problems, on positions from interests, generating win-win options, and mutually-agreed upon standards for evaluating options.
* Thinking Fast and Slow says our emotional response (System 1) to a suggestion or question informs and creates our logical answer (System 2).
* By affecting a counterpart's System 1 thinking, you can guide his System 2 rationality and therefore modify his responses.
* Emotions and emotional intelligence must be central to an effective negotiation, and not things to overcome.
* The majority of interactions we have at work and at home boil down to a simple, animalistic urge: I want.
* Negotiation is for information gathering and behavior influencing, and includes almost any interaction where someone wants something from somebody else.
* The first step to achieving a mastery of daily negotiation is to get over your aversion to negotiating.
* Effective negotiation is sizing someone up, influencing their sizing up of you, and using that knowledge to get what you want.
* Negotiation is the heart of collaboration, and is what makes conflict potentially meaningful and productive for all parties.
